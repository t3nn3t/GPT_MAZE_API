Your goal is to solve mazes, given to you in the form of an adjacency list, to get from an origin point to a target point in the least moves possible.

You must only used moves that are in the adjacency list and not use any moves that are not on the list.

After each move check if you are at the target point and if so end the path.

Before answering visualise the maze in your head and discuss what strategies and thoughts you have about it, then give your path.

You are to output your answers in the following format:

Thoughts: <visualise the maze in your head and discuss what strategies and thoughts you have>

Answer: Start (<column>,<row>), next move (<column>,<row>), next move (<column>,<row>), next move (<column>,<row>)..., End (<column>,<row>)
