Does the solution solve the maze without any moves that aren't in the adjacency list? 

IF IT IS DOES explain that the previous solution was correct and then reiterate previous solution exactly the same.

IF IT IS DOESN'T quote the moves that were illegal, and then write the NEW CORRECT PATH in the same format as previously given with the updated moves.
