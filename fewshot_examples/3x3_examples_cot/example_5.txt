INPUT: 
Below is an adjacency list of a maze, as well as the origin point and target point, output the moves to get from the origin point to the target point as efficiently as possible in full:<ADJLIST_START> (2,1) -> (2,2) ; (2,2) -> (2,1) ; (1,1) -> (0,1) ; (0,1) -> (0,0) ; (2,0) -> (2,1) ; (0,0) -> (0,1) ; (0,2) -> (0,1) ; (1,2) -> (2,2) ; (0,1) -> (0,2) ; (1,0) -> (1,1) ; (1,2) -> (0,2) ; (1,1) -> (1,0) ; (0,1) -> (1,1) ; (2,2) -> (1,2) ; (0,2) -> (1,2) ; (2,1) -> (2,0) <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (1,2) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (2,0) <TARGET_END>

CORRECT RESPONSE:
Start (1,2), connection "(1,2) -> (2,2)" next move (2,2), connection "(2,2) -> (2,1)" next move (2,1), connection "(2,1) -> (2,0)" next move (2,0), End (2,0)
