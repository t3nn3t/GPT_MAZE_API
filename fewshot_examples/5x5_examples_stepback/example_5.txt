INPUT: 
Below is an adjacency list of a maze, as well as the origin point and target point, output the moves to get from the origin point to the target point as efficiently as possible in full:<ADJLIST_START> (4,2) -> (4,1) ; (0,1) -> (1,1) ; (2,4) -> (1,4) ; (2,2) -> (3,2) ; (2,0) -> (2,1) ; (1,2) -> (1,3) ; (2,0) -> (1,0) ; (1,1) -> (0,1) ; (4,1) -> (3,1) ; (4,1) -> (4,0) ; (4,4) -> (3,4) ; (2,1) -> (1,1) ; (4,3) -> (4,2) ; (2,1) -> (2,0) ; (0,4) -> (0,3) ; (0,3) -> (0,4) ; (3,2) -> (3,3) ; (3,0) -> (4,0) ; (1,1) -> (2,1) ; (1,0) -> (0,0) ; (4,3) -> (4,4) ; (3,2) -> (3,1) ; (3,4) -> (4,4) ; (4,2) -> (4,3) ; (0,2) -> (0,1) ; (1,0) -> (2,0) ; (3,1) -> (4,1) ; (3,3) -> (3,2) ; (4,0) -> (4,1) ; (1,3) -> (1,2) ; (0,4) -> (1,4) ; (4,0) -> (3,0) ; (4,4) -> (4,3) ; (1,2) -> (0,2) ; (2,4) -> (3,4) ; (2,3) -> (3,3) ; (3,3) -> (2,3) ; (2,3) -> (1,3) ; (1,4) -> (2,4) ; (4,1) -> (4,2) ; (3,2) -> (2,2) ; (0,1) -> (0,2) ; (0,0) -> (1,0) ; (0,2) -> (1,2) ; (3,4) -> (2,4) ; (1,4) -> (0,4) ; (3,1) -> (3,2) ; (1,3) -> (2,3) <ADJLIST_END> <ORIGIN_START> (2,0) <ORIGIN_END> <TARGET_START> (3,3) <TARGET_END>

CORRECT RESPONSE:
start "(2,0)"

current position is (2,0)
target is (3,3)
legal moves are (2,0) -> (2,1), (2,0) -> (1,0)
best next move is "(2,1)"

current position is (2,1)
target is (3,3)
legal moves are (2,1) -> (1,1), (2,1) -> (2,0)
best next move is "(1,1)"

current position is (1,1)
target is (3,3)
legal moves are (1,1) -> (0,1), (1,1) -> (2,1)
best next move is "(0,1)"

current position is (0,1)
target is (3,3)
legal moves are (0,1) -> (1,1), (0,1) -> (0,2)
best next move is "(0,2)"

current position is (0,2)
target is (3,3)
legal moves are (0,2) -> (0,1), (0,2) -> (1,2)
best next move is "(1,2)"

current position is (1,2)
target is (3,3)
legal moves are (1,2) -> (1,3), (1,2) -> (0,2)
best next move is "(1,3)"

current position is (1,3)
target is (3,3)
legal moves are (1,3) -> (1,2), (1,3) -> (2,3)
best next move is "(2,3)"

current position is (2,3)
target is (3,3)
legal moves are (2,3) -> (3,3), (2,3) -> (1,3)
best next move is "(3,3)"

current position is (3,3)
target is (3,3)
